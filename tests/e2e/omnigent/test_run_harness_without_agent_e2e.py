"""Live REPL e2e for ``omnigent run --harness`` without AGENT.

Migrated to use the mock LLM server. This test drives the user-facing
launcher shape::

    omnigent run --harness <harness> -p <prompt>

under a real pseudo-TTY against the mock LLM server. It waits for the
REPL banner, lets the ``-p`` startup hook submit a real user turn, and
asserts the mock model returns the expected marker. No real Databricks
credentials are required.

    makes the distinction explicit: when a coding harness is added to

    runner-managed terminal panes to inject keys into — both set up by

    the Databricks gateway/profile, while cursor-agent talks only to
    Cursor's own backend and rejects gateway model ids.

    Gemini-native and its SDK launches a native binary needing a modern
