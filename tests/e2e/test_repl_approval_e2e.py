"""
REPL approval-flow e2e test.

Spawns ``omnigent chat examples/agents/ask-demo/`` as a subprocess
under a pseudo-TTY (pexpect), feeds real input, and asserts
the agent responds after the user approves a policy ASK.
This exercises the full Phase 10 path — prompt_toolkit's
real input loop, the SSE stream consuming ``ElicitationRequest``
events, the REPL's future-based approval wiring, and the
server PATCHing the verdict back through DBOS.

Unlike ``test_policies_e2e.py`` (polling API, background=True),
this test drives the REPL through the actual streaming code
path — the code path a human types into at the terminal.

Prerequisites:
    - ``pexpect`` installed (4.9+).
    - ``--llm-api-key`` pytest option set to a valid key for
      ``openai/gpt-4o``.
    - ``ap`` on ``PATH`` resolving to this worktree's entry
      point (set ``PYTHONPATH`` so the editable install from
      a sibling worktree doesn't shadow it).

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/omnigent-policies:\\
    /home/ubuntu/omnigent-policies/sdks/python-client:\\
    /home/ubuntu/omnigent-policies/sdks/frontend \\
    python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_repl_approval_e2e.py \\
      --llm-api-key $(cat /tmp/mykey) -v
